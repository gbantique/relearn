<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">ESP-WROOM-32 \* Dual-core, 32-bit microcontroller module  
\* CPU cores can be individually controlled  
\* Clock frequency up to 240MHz  
\* Multiple power modes  
\* Integrated WiFi, Bluetooth (classic) and BLE  
\* Multiple digital and analog I/O pins

\* ESP-WROOM-32 is one of the ESP32 series of microcontrollers  
\* Manufactured by Espressif Systems  
\* Sucessor to the ESP8266  
\* Released September 2016  
\* Used in many development boards

\* 18 12-bit ADC  
\* 2 8-bit DAC  
\* 10 capacitive touch sensor inputs  
\* 4 SPI bus channels  
\* 2 I2C bus connections  
\* 2 I2S bus connections (bus that can carry audio)  
\* 3 UART for serial communication

\* SD card host controller  
\* IR remote controller, up to 8 channels  
\* Motor PWM  
\* LED PWM, up to 16 channels  
\* Hall effect sensor  
\* Ultra low-power analog preamp  
\* Real Time clocks

\* Most pins on ESP-WROOM-32 have multiple functions  
\* Some function conflicts, not all can be used simultaneously  
 – some cannot be use while wifi is use  
\* Not all development boards expose all pins  
\* Some pins not recommended for use  
\* Some GPIO pins can function as input only, cannot provide output

Some boards:  
1\. Node MCU32S  
 – micro USB connector for programming  
 – 2 push button

2\. DOIT  
 – micro USB connector for programming  
 – 2 push button  
 – OLED display  
 – LIPO battery connector

3\. ESP32 Cam  
 – integrated camera  
 – micro SD card slot  
 – connector for small antenna  
 – NO micro USB connector, needs FTDI

4\. Sparkfun  
 – micro USB connector  
 – LIPO battery connector  
 – small footprints ESP32 mcu

Arduino IDE  
 – not the only way to program the ESP-32 infact even not the best way. But it is the most comfortable especially for beginners.

Add the ESP-32 board using Board Manager
