I am fascinated how easy it is to build an mp3 player using a DF Player Mini. DF Player mini is a cheap mp3 player.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">![DF Player Mini image](https://techtotinker.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DF-Player-Mini-Pinout.png)</figure>## MATERIALS:

1\. DF Player mini  
2\. Breadboard  
3\. Battery / power supply  
4\. Speaker  
5\. A couple of jumper wires  
6\. A micro SD card with some mp3 files loaded.

<div> </div>## HARDWARE INSTRUCTION:

1\. Insert the micro SD card to the DF player mini.  
2\. Place the DF player mini to the breadboard.  
3\. Connect power supply +5V to VCC pin (pin 1, please refer to below picture)  
4\. Connect power supply ground to GND pin (pin 7).  
5\. Connect the speaker â€“ pin to SPK\_1 (pin 6) and speaker + pin to SPK\_2 pins (pin 8).  
6\. Connect a jumper wire to GND pin (pin 10)

<div> </div>## BASIC OPERATION:

So basically, IO\_1 and IO\_2 is used as follows:  
1\. short press IO\_1: play previous  
2\. long press IO\_1: volume down  
3\. short press IO\_2: play next  
4\. long press IO\_2: volume up
