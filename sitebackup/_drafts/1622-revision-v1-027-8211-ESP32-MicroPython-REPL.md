Welcome to my blog, where we will be diving into the fascinating world of MicroPython REPL and how to leverage Thonny IDE for seamless development.

What is MicroPython REPL?  
MicroPython REPL is the interactive console provided by MicroPython, a version of the Python programming language designed for microcontrollers like the ESP32. REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop, which allows you to enter Python code, execute it, and immediately see the results. With MicroPython REPL in Thonny IDE, you can control hardware, run code interactively, and develop projects easily.
